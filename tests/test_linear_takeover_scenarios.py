"""take_over from chat: real upstream Kanban, the registered chat handler and a synthetic Linear.

The requesting agent is never the old owner. It reaches the owner only through the configured
owner command, simulated here by a recorded runner that returns what the owner's
``hermes linear hand-off`` prints. A takeover ends with one task here and this app as delegate
(replacing exactly the old delegate), with nothing changed and a plain reason, or with the owner
left paused and a plain message (in the reply and on the issue) naming the two ways on. Two
agents never run the work: nothing resumes the owner except a person's resume_owner, which is
refused while the work runs here or the issue is delegated elsewhere, and a takeover task is
admitted only by the take_over call that has just proven the handover, never later.
The owner side itself (stop, proof, resume) is proven in test_linear_origin_handoff_native.py.
