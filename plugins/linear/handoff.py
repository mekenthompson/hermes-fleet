"""Owner side of an agent-to-agent takeover: stop, prove, hand over. Nothing resumes by itself.

``hermes linear hand-off`` runs inside the profile that owns the work (the old delegate),
started by the requester's ``take_over`` through the operator-configured owner command.
In one call, in code, it:

1. checks everything that can be checked before touching the work (the issue's reporting
   link, the one native task, its issue scope, guarded controls, the native Stop getter and
   any tasks it started) and refuses with nothing changed if any of them fails;
2. pauses the task with one guarded native Stop whose reason names the handover and carries
   the request id;
3. waits for the existing cleanup proof (``cleanup.inspect``) to show the stopped work has
   fully ended, and reports ``handed_off`` with the evidence.

Two agents never run the same work, so nothing here ever resumes the task by itself. When the
proof fails after the pause, the work stays paused (``state: paused``) and the reply says so
plainly; only a person resumes it, through ``--resume`` (the requester's ``resume_owner``), or
retries the takeover. A task already paused for a handover to the same agent is proven again,
never stopped twice, so retrying with the same request id (or a new one) is safe. A pause made
outside this flow (a person's Stop) is only proven, never changed, and a pause for a handover
to a different agent is never proven for this one. One hand-off or resume runs per issue at a
time (a file lock beside the state database). Nothing here grants permission; the requester's
chat request is the authority, exactly as for ``work_on``.
