"""GitHub PR acceptance for Linear closeouts, around core's exact-head verifier.

Core's ``collect_acceptance`` reads the Checks API. A fine-grained token without
``checks:read`` is refused there (HTTP 403) although it can read pull requests,
commit statuses and Actions runs. Then, and only then, the required checks are
proved from GitHub Actions jobs instead, with the safeguards of hermes-agent
#133 / a3faa265: every requirement pinned to the GitHub Actions app, the exact
head SHA, the latest attempt of trusted runs (pull_request, push or merge_group)
whose head repository is the PR's own repository and whose workflow file (for the
runs that produce a required check) exists on the base branch, complete
pagination, and a final PR re-read that still shows the same head and base
(merged is accepted, closed without merging is not). As in core, every Actions run
on the head is read: a failed or unfinished required job in any of them refuses, and
only trusted runs can supply the success. Nothing is accepted that is not proved. Where Actions cannot stand in for the checks at all (requirements that
are not Actions jobs, a fork, only untrusted runs) the answer is the definite
"unprovable"; only GitHub refusing or not answering stays unverified.

``unverified`` separates "GitHub could not be asked" (refused, unreachable,
still running) from "GitHub answered no" (a check failed, the PR was closed, no
evidence). Only the first is worth asking again later.

Network work only; nothing here touches the store. gh's stderr is never kept.
