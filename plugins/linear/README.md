# Linear plugin

Linear is the human work record. Native Hermes Kanban owns tasks, execution, claims,
worker recovery, permissions and Stop. This plugin links records, accepts verified Linear
requests and reports native outcomes through a durable outbox. An issue, comment, assignee
or reporting destination never grants execution permission.

The native contract is official Hermes `ff294849385e433dd40a993b4f07673abb95c6f5`.
No fork-specific invocation context, lifecycle controller, approval reservation or chat recovery
API is required. The plugin is disabled by default.

## Tools

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `track` with `issue`, `task_id`, optional `board` | Link an existing task on the caller's native board or an explicitly selected existing board. No task creation, claim, restart, resume or transfer. |
| `status` with `issue` | Read the issue and linked native state, or retained migration/reconciliation information. |
| `followup` with `issue`, `body`, UUIDv4 `id` | Add an operator instruction to active linked native work. Stopped and completed work requires a current native action. |
| `create_issue` with UUIDv4 `id`, `title`, `team` | Create an undelegated issue; optional description/project/parent. |
| `create_project` with UUIDv4 `id`, `name`, `team` | Create a project. |
| `link_issue` with `issue`, `related`, `relation` | Relate existing issues. |
| `update_description` with `issue`, UUIDv4 `id`, `description`, `expected_description` | Queue a description replacement after checking the exact previous text. |
| `add_comment` with `issue`, UUIDv4 `id`, `body` | Queue a Linear comment. |

Ordinary content actions need no task link or chat ownership claim. They retain current app,
workspace and specialist authorization. Queued content receipts confirm durable capture, not
remote delivery. Use readable Linear Markdown. Description preflight is best effort; Linear
provides no remote compare-and-swap. Inspect conflicting human edits before replacing them.

Use existing native Kanban tools, Desktop controls or CLI for task creation, explicit resume,
cancellation and routing. Questions, short commands and bounded investigations work without
Linear. To continue active linked work, resolve its task and send a native operator comment;
opening another conversation does not replace its executor. Passive progress uses native
notification subscriptions with `notify`, never `wake` as an execution workaround.

Tracking preserves the native profile, board and task. The task must belong to the verified
executor profile. Native board validation and worker pins apply across the private RPC;
selecting a board cannot expand a worker's scope. Missing or archived boards are refused
without creating or reopening them. Subsequent status, follow-up and reporting use the
recorded board. The configured plugin board remains the creation destination for verified
Linear assignments, so linking an ordinary or project task does not require moving it.

Validated Linear assignments create a native task with `initial_status="blocked"`.
They are durable requests, not automatic execution. Activate them through an authorized native
Kanban action from any supported conversation or UI. No Linear claim or special wording is
needed. The plugin never unblocks a task. Upstream has no atomic initial-state/generation guard
for automatic activation; a read followed by unblock could undo a concurrent Stop. Keeping
creation parked closes the Stop-during-creation race without another execution controller.
Existing tasks created through native chat tools and already-running linked work are unaffected.

## Trusted host context

The registered handler captures the native session bound by upstream producers. It uses
`gateway.session_context.bound_session_key`, the current context's session variables and
`hermes_constants.get_hermes_home`; `profile_matches_home` checks the profile/home pair.
Environment-only session names and model-supplied identity fields are not credentials.
API turns use the actual upstream API-server session producer; messaging turns retain native
platform, user, route and session fields. An API session may have no messaging user ID; the
plugin preserves that fact and relies on the API host's existing admission.

Desktop/API processes use the same gateway bridge through a profile-private Unix socket.
Every action carries the complete captured context, including native delegated-child
restrictions. A delegated child cannot relay a native follow-up through the service. Both sides validate home/profile and
same-UID peer credentials; the directory is mode 700 and socket mode 600. Same-UID native
processes are the local trust boundary, not isolated hostile tenants. No transfer-only
allowlist or raw human phrase authorizes a request. Missing context, a different profile,
or an unavailable gateway produces an explicit refusal. After an uncertain response, inspect
delivery and reuse the original request ID; do not start another executor.

The service polls the existing ingress, persisted native events and Linear outbox in one
plugin-owned reporting thread. The upstream gateway host marker selects startup only; it is
not an authorization credential. Official `on_unload` stops that loop; Desktop/API discovery
registers the client without starting it. The private socket admits one reporting host. Registered
native lifecycle hooks only wake the service; callbacks perform no remote I/O or database
mutation. The persisted event cursor and queued effects provide restart catch-up. There is
no chat-stop loop, process controller or restart prose injection.

## Configuration

Add this to the profile's deployment overlay; the IDs are examples:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: [linear]
  entries:
    linear:
      settings:
        enabled: true
        identity:
          viewer_id: example-app-user-id
          organization_id: example-workspace-id
        credentials:
          mode: connect
          vault_id: example-vault-id
          item_id: example-item-id
          connect_env_file: /opt/data/.op.env
          cache_file: /opt/data/secrets/linear-oauth.json
        states:
          in_progress: In Progress
          done: Done
          blocked: Blocked
        ingress_database: /opt/data/workspace/linear/ingress.db
        recheck_minutes: 5
```

`token_file` credentials with `path` are also supported. OAuth and token caches remain private
profile state. The immutable viewer/workspace binding is revalidated on requests. Optional
`identity.teams` and `identity.projects` restrict issue access and writes. `state_database`
defaults to `<profile home>/linear/state.db`; optional `board` selects the destination for
Linear-origin task creation. `api_url`, `tick_seconds` (default 2), `team_states` and
`completion_contracts` retain their existing meanings.
`ingress_profile` selects the trusted inbox route only; it does not change caller authorization.
`activation_cutoff_ms` imports older signals without executing them and cannot retroactively
activate an existing state database. API quota backoff remains durable and profile-local.
A Linear outage delays reporting; unrelated native work and ordinary conversation continue.

Optional specialist scope requires exact nonempty `allowed_team_ids`, `allowed_project_ids`
and `allowed_requester_ids` lists. The organization-wide form uses explicit `all_teams: true`,
`all_projects: true` and nonempty `allowed_requester_ids`. `requester_basis: agent_session`
requires an authoritatively resolved session from an allowed requester, belonging to this app
and issue. Historical effects keep their original requester authority; a new session never
supplies missing authority to old writes. Creation and issue linking remain disabled in
specialist mode. General-mode Agent Sessions are also resolved through Linear and checked
against the configured app and issue scope; payload identity alone is insufficient.

## Migration and delivery limits

Existing chat/manual/old Kanban bindings, stopped work and uncertain deliveries remain visible
for reconciliation. The service does not automatically adopt, delete, close or replay them.
Keep their checkpoints, workspace/PR references and effect history. Reconcile them before
linking new native work. A reporting link is metadata, never a competing ownership lock.

Native create-task retry lookup is not an atomic exactly-once guarantee. A durable local
intent coalesces duplicate ingress; ambiguous in-flight creation stays pending for inspection.
Native comments have no idempotency key: the plugin retains ambiguous delivery and inspects
actual comments before retrying. Marker text is provenance, never authorization. Native
resume has no expected-generation compare-and-swap; stale Linear resume requests remain
visible for a current authorized native action. Native Stop is the supported execution control.
Linear Stop is relayed only when the current native run and ordering can be verified. Other
requests remain visible for native reconciliation. A blocked task or Stop acknowledgement is
not proof that an external process or effect ended; inspect native process/effect state.

Before status mutations/retries the bridge re-reads Linear so human reassignment/closure wins.
This revalidation does not provide remote compare-and-swap; conflicting or unverifiable
mutation responses remain subject to reconciliation.
The local outbox preserves UUIDs and uncertain external effects. Use the profile CLI:

```bash
hermes linear status
hermes linear resolve <row> applied|not_applied --evidence "verified remote outcome"
hermes linear replay <delivery>
```

Resolution records inspected evidence; it does not mutate Linear. Do not infer cancellation or
successful completion from a workflow label, an old comment or a lost response.

## Validation

`tests/test_linear_native_frontdoor_scenarios.py` exercises official producer → registered tool → Unix
socket → consumer boundaries via the manifest-verified `HERMES_AGENT_SRC`; the same suite is separately run against
the exact official snapshot above.
These are source/backend tests. Desktop, Telegram and Slack client round-trips and deployed
fleet behavior require separate live acceptance; source tests do not claim that evidence.
