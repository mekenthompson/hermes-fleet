# Overlay repository

Hermes Fleet is the public distribution. A separate **overlay repository** holds
deployment configuration: compose, fleet-wide Hermes defaults, per-agent
overrides, and unpublished binaries. That overlay is usually private.

This repository does not contain a real overlay. Copy
`examples/overlay-repo/` into a new git repo and replace the placeholders.

## Recommended layout

```text
your-fleet-overlay/
  compose.yaml                 Digest-pinned images. No secrets.
  fleet-config/
    schema.yaml                Allowlisted desired-state keys
    defaults.yaml              Shared defaults (every agent)
    agents/
      ops.yaml                 Per-agent overrides
      worker.yaml
  managed/
    ops.yaml                   Optional /etc/hermes/config.yaml mount
  image/                       Optional unpublished binaries + hashed manifest
  secrets/                     Not in git. Runtime injection only.
```

Sidecar *source* stays in hermes-fleet. The overlay pins sidecar *images* by
digest and supplies brand, timezone, and public URL skins as environment.

## Hermes config layers

`contracts/config.json` is the machine-readable split:

| Layer | Owner | Typical path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Image | public product | the Fleet child | Immutable. No profile identity. |
| Desired state | overlay repo | `fleet-config/` | Shared defaults, then role, then profile. |
| Managed policy | administrator | `/etc/hermes/config.yaml` | Small restart-gated policy. Not a secret boundary. |
| Temporary override | operator | not git | Expiring, audited. |
| Live profile | the agent | `/opt/data/config.yaml` | Exclusive profile state after first boot. |
| Secrets | external source | runtime injection | Never git, never image, never managed YAML. |

Desired-state precedence in that contract is `shared` → `role` → `profile` →
`temporary_override`. In this overlay sample:

- `fleet-config/defaults.yaml` is **shared**. Do not set `profile:`. `{profile}`
  in a string is replaced with the agent name at render time.
- `fleet-config/agents/<profile>.yaml` is **profile**. `profile:` must match the
  filename stem. Keys must be in `schema.yaml`.
- `managed/*.yaml` is the optional **managed** mount, not desired-state.

`fleet-config/` is renderer input in the overlay repo. Compose does not mount
it. Compose only shows the optional managed policy file.

Do not put credentials, OAuth state, memories, or sessions in the overlay git
tree. Secret values fail closed: never git, never image, never managed YAML.
Pin images by `@sha256:...`. Mutable tags are not a supported interface.

## Unpublished binaries

If a local CLI is not a public product yet, keep the hashed binary in the
overlay. Record it in a manifest, COPY it, and `sha256sum -c` during the
overlay image or foundation build. Do not vendor it into hermes-fleet.

## What the public repo is for

- Fleet child image and its plugins
- Independent sidecar source and GHCR workflows
- Contracts and examples

## What the overlay repo is for

- Who the agents are
- Compose topology
- Fleet-wide and per-agent Hermes defaults
- Digest pins for this deployment
- Private binaries and deployment overlays
